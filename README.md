## Disney Movie Visualizations
This project explores the relationships amongst Disney movie genres, release months, revenue, and ratings (G, PG, R, etc.). We have created 2 visualizations, which are detailed below.

### Disney Movies Stacked Bar Chart
This bar chart visualizes Disney movies' total gross revenue per month, stacked by genre, using D3.js. The bar chart shows the distribution of movie genres released between 2000 and the present, with each bar representing the total gross for movies released in a particular month. The bars are color-coded based on genre and stacked on top of each other.

### Disney Movie Ratings Scatterplot
This scatterplot utilizes the ratings of movies from the year 2000 and later to understand how the target audience of certain Disney movies impacts the revenue. Each point in the scatterplot will be marked as a circle, color-coded based on the rating (P, PG, R, etc.).

The graph provides insights into how Disney movie revenues vary by release month and year, highlighting seasonal patterns and differences in revenue over time.
